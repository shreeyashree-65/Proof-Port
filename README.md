# Proof-Port: A Portal of Verified Supplier Proofs

## 🌍 Project Overview

**Proof-Port** is a decentralized platform designed to verify supplier authenticity through blockchain technology. Suppliers upload proofs (e.g. certificates, compliance documents) that approved certifiers can verify. The goal is to prevent fraud, fake suppliers, and unverified vendors in global supply chains.

## ⚡ Why Proof-Port?

In real-world scenarios:
- 🌐 Large organizations lose millions due to **fake suppliers** or **fraudulent certifications**.
- Example: In 2021, several governments and corporations faced procurement scandals where fake vendors supplied counterfeit or substandard materials, causing both financial and reputational damage.
- Existing solutions are often centralized, expensive, and vulnerable to tampering.

**Proof-Port solves this** by offering:
✅ Transparent, tamper-proof proof records  
✅ Decentralized certifier system  
✅ Supplier-managed updates with traceability

## 🚀 How it works

1️⃣ **Suppliers** register and upload a hash of their proof (e.g. IPFS CID or NFT metadata)  
2️⃣ **Certifiers** (approved by contract owner) review and approve/revoke proofs  
3️⃣ **Buyers / stakeholders** can verify a supplier’s status transparently on-chain
